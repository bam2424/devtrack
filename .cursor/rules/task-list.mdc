# Task List Management

Guidelines for creating and managing task lists in markdown files to track project progress

## Task List Creation

1. Create task lists in a markdown file (in the project root):
   - Use `TASKS.md` 
   - Include a clear title and description of the feature being implemented

2. Structure the file with these sections:
   ```markdown
   # Feature Name Implementation

   Brief description of the feature and its purpose.

   ## Completed Tasks

   - [x] Task 1 that has been completed
   - [x] Task 2 that has been completed

   ## In Progress Tasks

   - [ ] Task 3 currently being worked on
   - [ ] Task 4 to be completed soon

   ## Future Tasks

   - [ ] Task 5 planned for future implementation
   - [ ] Task 6 planned for future implementation

3. make sure md files are added to the gitignore
